Overgrown City: Before the Fall

The vines didn’t crawl overnight.

They leapt.

When the first tendrils of synthetic ivy burst from the city's sewer grates, no one panicked. Not at first. The news called it an “urban renewal phenomenon.” By week two, the mayor’s office was swallowed by kudzu with teeth.

Juno stared out over the ruins of Sector 9 from the rusted rooftop of what used to be a Whole Foods. Nature had reclaimed more than buildings—it had rewritten the laws of survival. Wind howled through broken windows, birds called in strange digital screeches. Somewhere below, the hollow clang of a vending machine echoed… and then something screamed.

Her machete—named Marsha—was strapped to her back. Marsha didn’t scream. She solved things.

Juno wasn’t alone.

She rolled her eyes as her companion, Brick, a seven-foot-tall ex-janitor with a soft spot for pigeons, climbed onto the roof carrying two cans of beans and a tactical spoon.

“You ever wonder,” Brick asked between gulps, “if the plants got smart because we stopped paying attention?”

“No,” Juno replied. “I think they got smart because someone made them that way.”

She flicked on her cracked wristpad and replayed the message she found scrawled in blood on the back of a drone:

THE ROOTS ARE CODE. GET TO THE ARCHIVE.

Below them, the overgrowth shifted.

Branches didn’t move like that unless something inside them moved first.

Brick squinted. “Please tell me that’s not another vinebeast.”

A massive pod unfurled across the boulevard, petals twitching, teeth inside glistening like shattered glass. It roared in a mix of jaguar and dial-up modem.

“Okay,” Juno said, standing, gripping Marsha. “That’s new.”

The sky cracked with thunder, but the clouds were silent.

They weren’t clouds.

They were spores.

A single line of text scrolled across her wristpad:

You have 13 hours before root protocol completes.

Brick looked at her, then at the spore-clouds.

“...Well, sh*t.”
