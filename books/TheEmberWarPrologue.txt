The Ember War: The Day the Sky Bled

The prophecy was never sung.
It was screamed.

In the mountain village of Kael’dar, fire was sacred. It was warmth, it was life—and most importantly, it was contained. Until the gods got lazy and left the gate open.

A week before the burning skies, Ashryn, a lowborn blacksmith’s apprentice with one eye and a dragon-sized grudge, discovered a sword buried under her master’s forge. Not forged—grown. From obsidian and bone. It whispered in languages her ears had no business understanding.

And it wanted blood.

She named it Kindle. Kindle named her back.

On the night of the Red Comet, flames erupted from the castle’s mosaic windows. Not from siege—from within. The high mages combusted mid-ritual, their bodies puppeted by glowing glyphs that branded themselves onto the stone walls as if mocking death.

Ashryn didn't know it yet, but that was the moment the Warbringers awoke.

As the sky split open with fire and the first ember wraith descended—a beast cloaked in smoke, eyes like molten glass—she and her sword stood alone at the village gates.

Well, almost alone.

A goat named Fizzle butted her leg.

“Now?” she groaned.

Fizzle bleated once. Then twice. Then exploded.

Ashryn was thrown fifty feet into a hay cart and awoke with a grin and a mouth full of straw.

“That counts as a sign,” she muttered, grabbing Kindle and standing.

The village elder, half-possessed and full of riddles, appeared in a vision of smoke.
“The Ember King remembers you, Ashryn. He remembers what you were before fire. He’s coming to finish what he started.”

Ashryn spat out a tooth.

“Then he better bring backup.”

Above, embers spiraled from the heavens like falling stars—except they screamed.

The first true battle of the Ember War began not with a horn—but with a girl, a sword, and a goat that died doing what it loved:

Exploding dramatically.
